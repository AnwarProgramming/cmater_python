### Sorry !

# I didn't Understand the question to I asked to LLM and they give me the following answer:






# Python program to assign values to variables and display them using a single print statement

# Assigning values to variables
name = "Alice"
age = 25
city = "New York"
height = 1.65  # in meters
is_student = True

# Displaying all variables using a single print statement
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, City: {city}, Height: {height}m, Is Student: {is_student}")
