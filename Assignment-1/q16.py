## Sorry ! 
## Again I use LLM because I don't understand the question



# Python program demonstrating an assignment statement and an expression statement
# to calculate the square of a number

# Assignment statement: binds the value 7 to the variable 'number'
number = 7

# Assignment statement: calculates the square and stores it in 'square'
square = number * number

# Expression statement: calls the print() function to display the result
print(f"The square of {number} is {square}")



#Oh I got it... :)
# previously I was taking information from input in this case I have to directly assign a number and then express it.
